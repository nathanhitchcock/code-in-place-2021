Digital negative
Write a program in digital_negative.py which takes a TextGrid of 0s and 1s and changes all 0s to 1s, and all 1s to 0s.

Here's a sample run of the program on zero_one.txt, which is the default file:

```
$ python digital_negative.py
Initial grid:
0000
1111
New grid:
1111
0000
```

We've additionally provided you with a checkerboard.txt file to test your code on; you can run your program on this file by changing DEFAULT_FILENAME to 'checkerboard.txt'.

Recall that you can access the value of a cell in the TextGrid using cell.value, and that all letter values are strings, not ints!
