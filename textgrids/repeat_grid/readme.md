Repeat grid
Write a program in repeat_grid.py that copies gridonto final_grid over and over, NUM_REPEATS times, side by side. Here's a sample run of the program on the default grid, abcd.txt, with NUM_REPEATS = 2 (this is the default value):

```
$ python repeat_grid.py
Initial grid:
AB
CD
Final grid:
ABAB
CDCD
```
